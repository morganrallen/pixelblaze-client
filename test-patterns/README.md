## Test patterns for use with example.py

These Pixelblaze patterns can be used with the sample "example.py" if you 
don't wish to use your own.  KITT and Bouncer3D are identical to the patterns
in the library at electromage.com.  "Many Controls" tests the use of multiple
color pickers in a single pattern. 

To use, just install the patterns you don't already have on your Pixelblaze.
